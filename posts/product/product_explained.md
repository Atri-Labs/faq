# What are we building at Atri Labs?

- We are building a full-stack framework on top of React (think in the leagues of Next.js, Remix.run, Gatsby.js, etc.)
- Since it is a full-stack framework, users can build both frontend and backend. 
- To build frontend, they can a mix of React code and productivity tools such as visual editor.
  - Hence, depending on their web development skills, project-specific requirements and preferences, they can write as much or as little code as they want.
- The backend can be written in Python. 
  - We are planning to add support for NodeJS soon.
- Once the app is built, it can be then be deployed to GitHub pages, AWS, etc. in one step using our command line tool. 

> ⚠️ Atri framework is not a low-code/no-code tool. It is a developer-focused product that is **bringing the best of the no-code world into the pro-code world**.
