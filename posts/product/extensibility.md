# Extensibility of Atri editor

Extensibility has been a very important guiding principle from Day 1 of the development of Atri editor. 

> ðŸ’¡ **We are planning to explore opportunities to file software patents for our unique implementations of extensibility.**

#### What type of extensibility is allowed at the moment?

At the moment, users can extend the editor by adding new components. 

Offering our community to extend the Atri editor in other ways is not our focus for the next 6-8 months. Our two key engineering and business goals are:

- Release stable version (1.0.0) of Atri framework
- Build a community of 100k+ users of Atri framework 

Our view is that the right time to seek community contributions on the extensibility of Atri editor (and Atri framework, as well for that matter) will be when we would have achieved project-community fit.
