# Development experience of an Atri App creator

1. The framework is evoked through the `Terminal` from inside the project repository.
2. The software runs locally on the user's system during the development period. 
3. The user events are compiled at each `Build and Run`. This generates the corresponding code and automatically saves it in the project repository.

4. Besides, Atri developers do not need to write REST APIs.  Instead, they rely upon the Atri object model which acts as a single source of truth. 
   - Frontend and backend teams now do not need to spend time in maintaining documentation for their APIs 
   - This also has other benefits such as reducing compliance breaches because it is not possible to accidentally send sensitive information from backend to frontend without modifying the object model.

#### Contextualizing development experience 

To contextualize this development experience, we can think of how web developers build a React app using the `create-react-app` library. 
- The library abstracts away many of the commonly required, cumbersome tasks (both easy and hard problems).
- At the same time, developers still retain complete access and control of their code.
