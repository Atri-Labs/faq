# Nuanced perspective on contributions

Some industry outsiders have this perception that `contributions = code contributors shown in GitHub` and consequently `fewer contributions = bad`. 

This is incorrect in several respects because:

1. This ignores the role that support infrastructure plays in the success of an open-source project. 
   - This support infrastructure includes documentation, utility libraries, community management, etc. 
   - None of this appears on the `GitHub code contributions` graph. 
   - As a result, more and more projects are moving towards the [all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) specification because it acknowledges and highlights all types of contributions. 
 
2. Not every project wants external contributions to its codebase. In our case, we have been operating at a rapid iteration mode. 
   - To seek active code contributor base would mean that we will have an additional overhead of maintaining rigorous documentation of our codebase. (Note that this is different from the documentation that we maintain for Atri app creators). 
   - Moreover, in order to make meaningful contributions to our framework, one needs to possess intermediate to advanced proficiency in web technologies. Sourcing such engineers would require considerable effort from our end. Hence, it does not land high on our priority list. 

3. To handle inbound interest to contribute, there are fewer issues that we could assign to a newcomer. 

   -  is not most people's cup of tea. 
   - a casual open-source contributor may contribute meaningfully to a library's repository but will not be suitable
